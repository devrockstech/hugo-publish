# Cloud Security - Enabling "Secure from the Start"

Secure from the start" in the context of cloud computing refers to the practice of incorporating security measures and considerations into the design, development, and deployment of cloud-based systems and services from the beginning of their lifecycle. This approach aims to build security into every aspect of the cloud environment, rather than adding it as an afterthought.
